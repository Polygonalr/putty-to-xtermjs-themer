# PuTTY to xterm.js Theme Converter

There's not really any preset themes for [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) readily available on the Internet for xterm.js. But instead of creating some to work with, how about a tool to convert currently available PuTTY themes for xterm.js?

Works with any .reg file from [putty-color-themes](https://github.com/AlexAkulov/putty-color-themes), tested to work with [WeTTY](https://github.com/butlerx/wetty)

## Requisite(s)

 *  Python 3

## Usage

`python putty_to_xtermjs_themer.py [puttyTheme.reg] [output.json]`
